          There are 2 players. One player becomes the codemaker, the other the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a code made of four colors. Duplicates are allowed. Blank spaces are not allowed. The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within 10 turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of colored circles on the decoding board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key circles in the small holes of the row with the guess. A red key is placed for each color circle from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key indicates the existence of a correct color circle placed in the wrong position. Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all rows of the decoding boards are full.
